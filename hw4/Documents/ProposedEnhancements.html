<h2> Proposed Enhancements </h2> 
	
	<h4>More robust computer</h4> 
		<p></p>

	<h4>Caching </h4> 
		<p>We believe that it could be a good idea to be able to cach the solution of the subtasks. For example: Instead of compute the number of fibonacci 4 every time, we could cach the solution and we would save time and computation power. One solution is to use a hashMap and use the number of the fibonacci as the key and the solution as the value. </p>
